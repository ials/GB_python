# Geospatial analysis and representation for data science

this website contains the documentation produced during the course in Geospatial analysis and representation for data science for the students in data science of the University of Trento

## Course information
### description
The laboratory aims to provide the necessary basis for learning how to manage, analyze and visualize geospatial data through open source tools (geospatial libraries for python, qgis, R ...)

At the end of the course, students will be able to:
- understand the specificity of the geospatial data model
- elaborate and integrate geospatial data (vector and raster)
- create maps (also accessible via the web)
