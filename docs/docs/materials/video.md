The recordings are those of the lessons held in the online classroom with the students, so they can available only to the students of the course (privacy issues).

The recordings aren't so usefull for people not involved in the coruse becase do not lend themselves well to being disseminated in the absence of context, they also contain some organizational and technical issues such as audio problems, screen resolution problems, students' faces and other questions related to the normal life of a classroom (there are also the 10 minutes of the pause).
It is therefore not disclosable material without any of these premises.

If there are enough requests we could consider creating video lessons suitable for self-learning
