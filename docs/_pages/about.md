# Course information
## Description

The laboratory aims to provide the necessary basis for learning how to manage, analyze and visualize geospatial data through open source tools (geospatial libraries for python, qgis, R â€¦)

At the end of the course, students will be able to:

- understand the specificity of the geospatial data model
- elaborate and integrate geospatial data (vector and raster)
- create maps (also accessible via the web)

## Teaching Method
the teaching method chosen is ["hands-on learning"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning): 
at each lesson some geospatial analysis concepts are introduced showing python code (with Jupyter Notebook) on the fly.<br/>
Step by step students put the concepts into practice and also face everyday problems in data analysis.<br/>
At the end of each lesson an exercise is proposed to reinforce what has been learned.<br/>
In the next lesson the solution is then presented, thus repeating the concepts exposed and inserting something new.
